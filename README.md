# NeuralNetworks
This is the main project I am working on.
Right now, I am studying the book, "Neural Networks From Scratch in Python."
I could have used Tensorflow or Keras, but I couldn't get it to work. 
Now, I think I could have downloaded them, but I think it is more benifical to learn the math behind 
neual networks as well as a challenge.
