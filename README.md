# Neural Networks
The first folder cantains a neural network by Samson Zhang. His video helped me to learn neural networks a lot. The second file in the folder was my first atempt of creating a neural network.

The main project I am working on is the hand gesture regnition file. The other file is from when I first stared learning about neural networks.

This program tracks points on the hand what hand it is, as well as what gesture it is showing.
As of now, it can detect a fist, pointer finger, okay symbol, and an open palm.
